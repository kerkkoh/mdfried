# What is this?

`mdfried` is a markdown viewer for the terminal that renders headers as **Bigger Text** than the rest, if your terminal supports some graphics protocol. Not **bold**, not just *styled*, actually BIGGER, making markdown much more readable in a terminal.

# Features

* Big Headers™  
  Headers are actually rendered as images, or with the [Text Sizing Protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/text-sizing-protocol/).
* Image previews with multiple graphics protocols  
  Sixel, Kitty, and iTerm2 are supported in a long list of terminals. If no protocol is supported, falls back to [chafa](https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa/).
  See [ratatui-image](https://github.com/benjajaja/ratatui-image?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility-matrix) to see if your terminal does even have graphics support, and for further details.
  The images are "sliced" in rows, so that images scroll in and out of the viewport naturally.
* Pager with basic unix-page and Vi-style keybindings
* Search
* Links
  * Opens URLs with xdg-open (or equivalent on macos/windows).
  * Can follow local `.md` links.
  * Jump to headers in `#kebab-case`.
* URL opening
  * Can directly open a URL that serves a markdown document.
  * Can directly open `github:<owner>/<repo>`, if it contains a `README.md` on `master` or `main`.
  * Transform any URL before opening with a configurable command.
    For example, `url_transform_command = "readable | html2text"` first transforms the webpage into something like FireFox's "reader mode", and then converts to markdown.
* Syntax highlighting in codeblocks with [arborium](https://arborium.bearcove.eu)
* Mermaid diagram rendering 
  Via the internal image renderer, an external image command, or a configurable terminal-text command.
  See [Mermaid configuration](assets/docs/help_configuration.md) for setup.
* Experimental PDF support
  If enabled with the `pdf` feature, PDF files can be opened.
  Only recommended for terminals that use the kitty protocol.
* Theme [configuration](#configuration) support


# Installation

Packaged in distros:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/mdfried.svg)](https://repology.org/project/mdfried/versions)

* Rust cargo: `cargo install mdfried`
  * From source : `cargo install --path .`
  * Needs a chafa package with development headers, usually called something like `libchafa-dev`, `libchafa-devel`, or just `libchafa`, or even just `chafa`.
  * If chafa is not available at all, or you don't care about it because your terminal supports some graphic protocol, then use `--no-default-features`.
  * If `cargo install ...` fails, try it with `--locked`, and report an issue.
* Nix flake: `github:benjajaja/mdfried`
* Download [release](https://github.com/benjajaja/mdfried/releases/latest) `.deb` and binaries for Mac and Windows.

# Usage

### Running

```
mdfried ./path/to.md
```

If the font could not be autodetected, you may have to pick a font the first time.
You should pick the same font that your terminal is using, but you could pick any.
The font is rendered directly as a preview.
Once confirmed, the choice is written into the configuration file.

Use `--setup` to force the font-setup again if the font is not right (anymore).

See `--help` for all options, and `--print-config` to see a mostly complete [configuration](#configuration) example.

### Key bindings

The keybindings should the basics of general CLI pagers.
Vi-style keybindings are prioritized, but "normal" keys should be usable as well.

Type `:help` in the program to see the exact list, or see [assets/docs/help.md](assets/docs/help.md).

### Configuration

`~/.config/mdfried/config.toml` is automatically created on first run.

`mdfried --print-config` prints out a full example config with a full theme.

Type `:help configuration` in the program to see detailed explanation, or see [assets/docs/help_configuration.md](assets/docs/help_configuration.md).

### Changelog

Type `:changelog` or see See [assets/docs/CHANGELOG.md](assets/docs/CHANGELOG.md).
