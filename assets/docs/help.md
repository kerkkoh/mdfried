## Link Navigation

Upon pressing `n` or `N`, "link mode" is activated. 
The nearest hyperlink is highlighted.
Pressing `n` again highlights the next hyperlink, and `N` goes backwards.
Pressing `Enter` opens the hyperlink.
"Opens" means different things, depending on the current source and the link itself.

* If the link ends in `.md`, it will be opened as new document.
* If the link is relative, it will be opened with the same current base URL (if any).
* If the link does not end in `.md`, and `url_transform_command` is configured, it will be fetched, transformed, and openend as new document.

Pressing `Esc` exits "link mode".

Links that are in `#kebab-case` are interpreted as "link to headers", internal to the document, and scroll the document to the referred header.

## Search

Upon pressing `/`, "search mode input" is activated.
This is indicated by a green `/` in the status bar.

You can then type and erase the search term, highlights in the viewport will be made visible immediately.
Press enter to complete the input, then "search mode" is activated, which works just like [Link Navigation](#link-navigation).
